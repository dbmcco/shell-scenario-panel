# Claude Code 2.0 Improvements Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚ùå Wrong Hook Names ‚Üí ‚úÖ Standard Hook Names

**Before:**
```json
"hooks": {
  "pre-session": ".claude/hooks/pre-session.sh",
  "post-specialist": ".claude/hooks/post-specialist-consultation.sh",
  "scenario-validation": ".claude/hooks/scenario-validation.sh"
}
```

**After:**
```json
"hooks": {
  "pre-session": ".claude/hooks/pre-session.sh",
  "post-task": ".claude/hooks/post-task.sh"
}
```

**Why:** Claude Code 2.0 only recognizes `pre-session`, `pre-task`, and `post-task`. Custom hook names like `post-specialist` are not triggered.

### 2. ‚ùå Environment Variable Dependencies ‚Üí ‚úÖ No Dependencies

**Before (post-specialist-consultation.sh):**
```bash
if [ -z "$SCENARIO_ID" ]; then
    echo "‚ùå Error: SCENARIO_ID not set"
    exit 1
fi

if [ -z "$SPECIALIST" ]; then
    echo "‚ùå Error: SPECIALIST not set"
    exit 1
fi

TRANSCRIPT_PATH="$SCENARIO_DIR/conversations/${SPECIALIST}_transcript.md"
```

**After (post-task.sh):**
```bash
# General reminder about documentation requirements
echo "‚úÖ Task completed"
echo ""
echo "üìù Moderator Responsibilities:"
echo "   - Verify specialist created transcript in conversations/"
echo "   - Check transcript contains >100 words of analysis"
```

**Why:** Task tool doesn't pass custom environment variables to hooks. Hooks can't know which specialist was invoked or which scenario is active.

---

### 3. ‚ùå Hooks Enforce Quality ‚Üí ‚úÖ Moderator Enforces Quality

**Before:** Hooks tried to validate specific specialist transcripts and block on failure

**After:** Hooks provide reminders; moderator (Dr. Wells) enforces quality through explicit protocol

**Design pattern:**
```
Task tool ‚Üí Specialist ‚Üí Transcript creation ‚Üí Moderator verification ‚Üí Proceed or re-invoke
```

**Why:** Hooks run automatically but lack context about which specialist was invoked. The moderator using Task tool has full context and can verify immediately.

---

### 4. ‚ùå Complex Hook Validation ‚Üí ‚úÖ Simple Hook Reminders

**Before:**
- Check specific transcript paths based on $SPECIALIST
- Validate metadata has consultation record
- Verify word counts
- Block workflow on failures

**After:**
- Display session info (pre-session)
- Remind moderator of responsibilities (post-task)
- No blocking validation

**Why:** Hooks should be simple and reliable. Complex validation requiring external context is fragile.

---

### 5. ‚ùå Unclear Responsibility ‚Üí ‚úÖ Explicit Moderator Protocol

**Added documentation:**
- `.claude/MODERATOR_PROTOCOL.md` - Detailed enforcement responsibilities
- Updated `prompts/moderator.md` - Explicit quality protocol
- Added OUTPUT FORMAT to all specialist prompts

**Moderator responsibilities:**
1. Invoke specialist via Task tool with explicit transcript path
2. Immediately verify transcript exists and has substance
3. Read and synthesize specialist insights
4. Update metadata with consultation record
5. Track progress with TodoWrite
6. Get user validation before proceeding

**Why:** Clear ownership prevents gaps. The moderator has context and ability to enforce.

---

### 6. ‚úÖ Added TodoWrite Integration

**Pattern:**
```
- [completed] Consulted economist on debt dynamics
- [in_progress] Synthesizing insights into predetermined_elements.md
- [pending] Get user validation before next specialist
```

**Why:** Claude Code 2.0 best practice - use TodoWrite to show workflow progress and track multi-step processes.

---

### 7. ‚úÖ Task Tool Invocation Pattern

**Standardized consultation pattern:**
```
Task("economist", "SCENARIO: SCENARIO-2025-001

QUESTION: What debt structures are locked in for the next decade?

TRANSCRIPT PATH: scenarios/active/SCENARIO-2025-001/conversations/economist_transcript.md

Analyze from your perspective and create the transcript as specified.")
```

**Why:**
- Moderator provides all context specialist needs
- Explicit transcript path eliminates ambiguity
- Specialist knows exactly what to create
- Moderator knows exactly what to verify

---

### 8. ‚úÖ Specialist Prompt Improvements

**Added to all specialist prompts:**
```markdown
## OUTPUT FORMAT

**1. Analyze the question** using your expertise

**2. Create your transcript** at the path specified by the moderator

Your transcript must include (minimum 100 words):
- **Your Analysis:** Reasoning and key insights
- **Critical Factors:** What matters most
- **Uncertainties:** What's genuinely uncertain
- **Contradictions:** Potential conflicts
- **Blind Spots:** What your perspective might miss

**3. Respond to the moderator** with a brief summary
```

**Why:** Self-contained prompts work better with Task tool. Specialist knows exactly what to do.

## Design Principles Applied

### Principle 1: Hooks are Simple
- No external dependencies
- No complex validation requiring context
- Provide information and reminders only

### Principle 2: Moderator is Responsible
- Explicit enforcement protocol
- Uses Task tool with full context
- Verifies immediately after consultation
- Clear quality gates

### Principle 3: Self-Contained Prompts
- Specialists receive all needed context
- Explicit output requirements
- No assumptions about environment

### Principle 4: Visible Progress
- TodoWrite tracks workflow
- Metadata records all activity
- User sees progress at each step

### Principle 5: Graceful Degradation
- If specialist doesn't create transcript, moderator can re-invoke
- No system-blocking failures
- User always in control

---

## Result

‚úÖ **Claude Code 2.0 compliant**
- Standard hook names
- No environment variable dependencies
- Simple, reliable hooks
- Clear responsibility model
- Task tool integration
- TodoWrite tracking
- Self-contained prompts

The system now works with Claude Code 2.0's actual execution model rather than fighting against it.
