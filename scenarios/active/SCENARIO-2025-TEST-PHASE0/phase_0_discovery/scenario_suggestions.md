# Scenario Suggestions for FreshValue Markets

Based on discovery research by all 6 domain specialists, here are recommended focal questions for scenario development:

---

## Suggestion 1: The Portfolio Question

**Focal Question:** "Which of our 32 stores should we continue operating, invest in, or exit over the next 5 years given uncertain rural market viability and capital constraints?"

**Why This Matters:**
Discovery revealed that FreshValue likely has a highly variable store-level performance distribution, with some stores subsidizing others. Not all small Midwest markets will remain economically viable, but it's unclear which ones will thrive vs. decline.

- **Economist found:** Store-level P&L likely ranges from strong profitability to cash drains. With 3.2% average EBITDA, some stores must be negative. Portfolio rationalization could significantly improve overall margins.
- **Geopolitician found:** Rural policy support uncertain - some markets may get infrastructure investment while others face managed decline. Food desert designation could create barriers to exit or opportunities for subsidies.
- **Ecologist found:** Climate impacts will affect markets differently - water availability, extreme weather, agricultural productivity vary by geography within FreshValue's footprint.
- **Futurist found:** Technology investment only viable at scale - may need to consolidate to fewer, larger, better-equipped stores rather than spreading capital thin across 32 locations.
- **Anthropologist found:** Community impact of store closures significant but not all communities equally viable. Some markets have alternatives (Walmart), others would become food deserts.
- **Contrarian found:** Consensus says "exit rural markets," but some may stabilize or revive. Need market-by-market assessment rather than blanket strategy.

**What This Would Explore:**
Scenarios would reveal optimal portfolio strategies under different combinations of rural market viability, policy support, competitor expansion, and capital availability. Would test strategies ranging from aggressive consolidation (exit 15+ stores) to patient optimization (improve all stores incrementally) to selective investment (concentrate resources on strongest markets). Outcome would be decision framework for which markets to defend, harvest, or exit.

## Suggestion 2: The Positioning Question

**Focal Question:** "Should we compete on operational efficiency and price competitiveness or double down on community connection and local differentiation over the next 3-5 years?"

**Why This Matters:**
FreshValue faces a classic strategic choice between two paths that require fundamentally different capabilities and investments. The company is currently stuck in the middle - not efficient enough to compete on price, not differentiated enough to command premium.

- **Economist found:** Current 3.2% EBITDA margin significantly below industry average suggests operational inefficiency. Could improve margins through operational excellence without changing positioning, or accept lower margins if differentiation justifies it.
- **Futurist found:** Technology investment ($15-25M) required to match competitors on efficiency - inventory AI, automated replenishment, labor optimization. But this competes with investments in community connection (store experience, local sourcing).
- **Anthropologist found:** Authentic community connection and local identity are real but undermonetized. Could be strengthened through storytelling, farmer partnerships, community engagement - but this requires different capabilities than operational efficiency.
- **Contrarian found:** Industry consensus says "must invest in technology and efficiency." But Trader Joe's and other successful grocers win through simplicity and distinctive positioning. Operational minimalism can be strategy, not weakness.
- **Ecologist found:** Local sourcing could shift from premium-priced niche to cost-competitive advantage if industrial food system costs rise. Positioning choice determines how to respond to this potential shift.
- **Geopolitician found:** Policy support for local food systems could make differentiation more economically viable. Efficiency strategy assumes current economics persist; differentiation strategy bets on policy tailwinds.

**What This Would Explore:**
Scenarios would test both strategic paths under different competitive, technological, and consumer behavior conditions. Would reveal which strategy is more resilient to which futures. Could also explore hybrid approaches or pivot strategies (start with efficiency, shift to differentiation if conditions favor it). Outcome would be strategic positioning choice with clear resource allocation implications.

## Suggestion 3: The Ownership Transition Question

**Focal Question:** "What ownership and governance structure should we transition to over the next 3-7 years given family succession uncertainty, capital requirements, and community stakeholder interests?"

**Why This Matters:**
The second-generation owners (ages 58-64) are approaching retirement with no clear succession plan. This decision can't be avoided - ownership transition is mandatory. But the form it takes will fundamentally reshape the company.

- **Economist found:** Business valuation likely challenged - subscale regional grocers face limited buyer universe. May be "no-bid" situation, forcing alternative structures. Real estate value may exceed operating business value, suggesting split strategies.
- **Geopolitician found:** FreshValue has political/social value as regional employer and food access provider that financial buyers may not value. Community ownership structures (co-op, employee ownership, local investors) could unlock non-financial support.
- **Anthropologist found:** Family ownership is part of authentic local narrative and employee culture. Sale to private equity or national chain could destroy social capital that is core competitive advantage.
- **Futurist found:** Strategic buyers might see technology investment opportunity, but would likely impose standardization that eliminates local autonomy. Consolidation play vs. community institution play have different buyer profiles.
- **Ecologist found:** Long-term stewardship (regenerative agriculture partnerships, sustainability investments) requires patient capital. Financial buyers optimize for 5-7 year exit; community ownership enables 20+ year horizon.
- **Contrarian found:** Consensus says "sell to highest bidder or liquidate." But employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs), community investment, or hybrid structures could preserve local character while accessing capital.

**What This Would Explore:**
Scenarios would test different ownership structures (private equity acquisition, strategic buyer merger, ESOP, community co-op, real estate sale-leaseback, family continuation) under different market, regulatory, and capital conditions. Would reveal which structure maximizes value for which stakeholders and under which futures. Outcome would be ownership transition roadmap aligned with family goals, employee interests, and community needs.
