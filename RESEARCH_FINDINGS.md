# Shell Scenario Planning Methodology: Research Report

## Executive Summary

This report documents Shell's actual scenario planning methodology as practiced by Pierre Wack, Peter Schwartz, Kees van der Heijden, and subsequent practitioners. The research focuses on expert collaboration structures, process sequencing, bias management, and documented best practices.

**Key Finding**: Shell's approach was NOT primarily workshop-based group facilitation. The scenario team worked separately, conducting extensive interviews and deep analysis over months, then presented scenarios to decision-makers to change their mental models.

## 1. Shell's Actual Methodology: How They Ran the Process

### 1.1 The Core Team Structure

**Pierre Wack's Team Approach (1970s-1980s)**

Shell's scenario planning was led by a dedicated scenario team that operated independently from decision-makers:

> "Wack and his team members never facilitated a group process. They interviewed people and thought deeply. They produced scenarios aimed at changing how decision-makers saw the world."
>
> Source: Wind4Change analysis of Pierre Wack Memorial Library documents, University of Oxford

**Team Induction Process**

The team operated on extended timescales with deep expertise development:

> "New recruits to the scenario team were inducted over a full year – a full planning cycle."
>
> Source: Pierre Wack Memorial Library documents, University of Oxford

This contrasts sharply with modern abbreviated approaches. Four common practices work against Wack's conception:
1. Reduction to a two-day workshop
2. Positioning scenarios as the outcome/product
3. Using scenarios in isolation without strategic options
4. Scenarios as a group process rather than targeted at decision-maker mental models

**Work Process Structure**

> "Leadership would tell Wack about a big problem or uncertainty, and he and his scenario team would go away and work on their process, then come back to the Managing Directors and present the scenarios without using executive time to build scenarios."
>
> Source: Interviews with scenario planning practitioners (found in research)

### 1.2 External Expert Engagement: "Remarkable People"

**The Concept**

> "Pierre Wack learned to cultivate what he called 'remarkable people' around the world; this phrase in French means not so much gifted or eccentric people, but people with unconventional insights about the world around them."
>
> Source: Strategy+Business article "The man who saw the future"

These individuals were selected for their "power to reframe the discussion at the crucial point in time" and "free-thinking style" - NOT traditional subject matter experts.

**Interview-Based Process**

Shell's process relied heavily on individual expert interviews, not group workshops with experts:

> "Shell included 'remarkable persons' to introduce novelty into scenario-based planning."
>
> Source: Academic literature on Shell scenario planning methodology

> "When Wack returned from his investigative travels, he made a series of presentations throughout Shell's operating divisions based on his accumulated knowledge and expertise."
>
> Source: Wind4Change analysis of Shell scenario planning

**Modern Continuation**

Contemporary practitioners continue this interview-intensive approach:

> "I believe we have done just under a thousand of interviews with this network of remarkable people. These are terribly long and deep interviews that take hours."
>
> Source: Daniel Erasmus, Digital Thinking Network (DTN), interview on scenario planning

### 1.3 Shell 2001 Project Structure

A documented Shell scenario project had explicit phases:

> "The Shell 2001 Global Scenarios project had four phases: Research, Scenario building (which included three workshops: 'orientation', 'building' and 'affirmation'), Application, and ongoing use."
>
> Source: Academic case study of Shell 2001 Global Scenarios project

During Application phase: "participants took ideas back to their Businesses informally, and once finalized, scenarios were presented at workshops and used to test strategies."

---

## 2. Expert Interaction Patterns: Isolated vs. Collaborative

### 2.1 Pierre Wack's Original Approach: Separate Work, Not Group Facilitation

**The Fundamental Pattern**

Wack's team did NOT run collaborative workshops where experts debated together. Instead:

- **Scenario team worked separately**: Small dedicated team conducted research and interviews
- **Individual expert interviews**: "Remarkable people" were interviewed individually, not brought together
- **Team synthesis**: The scenario team synthesized insights independently
- **Presentation to decision-makers**: Final scenarios were presented to change mental models

**Purpose and Philosophy**

> "For Pierre Wack, the objective has never been to predict the future. The aim of a scenario is to modify a decision-maker's mental model."
>
> Source: Multiple academic sources on Wack's philosophy

> "The primary purpose of scenarios is to change the way decision-makers see the world so that they will act with a wider, more informed point of view."
>
> Source: Scenario planning academic literature

**Timeline and Depth**

The work required "rigorous thinking, analysis and concentration stretched out over several months or more" - NOT rapid workshop convergence.

### 2.2 Later Shell Evolution: Incorporating Workshops

**Kees van der Heijden's "Strategic Conversation" Approach**

Van der Heijden, who led Shell's scenario planning after Wack, evolved the methodology to include more collaborative elements:

> "The work is typically done in workshops, typically off-site workshops taking two to three days."
>
> Source: Analysis of Kees van der Heijden's "Scenarios: The Art of Strategic Conversation"

> "Dialogue forms a critical component of scenario planning in general and is particularly helpful in shaping mental models and shared ideas."
>
> Source: Academic literature on van der Heijden's approach

**Workshop Team Composition**

> "The team should be multi-disciplinary, promote disbelief, think the unthinkable, and target novelty and relevance to the client."
>
> Source: Van der Heijden scenario workshop guidance

However, even with workshops, the emphasis remained on:
- Extended timescales (not just 2-3 days)
- Ongoing strategic conversation (not one-off events)
- Integration with broader organizational learning

### 2.3 Peter Schwartz and GBN: Hybrid Approach

**Facilitated Workshops with Interview Foundation**

Schwartz, who worked at Shell then founded Global Business Network (GBN), developed a hybrid model:

1. **Extensive pre-workshop interviews** with remarkable people
2. **Facilitated workshops** with key stakeholders
3. **Iterative refinement** over time

**Critical Success Factor: Diversity**

> "Diversity is the single most important characteristic for thinking about the future. Every time I have been wrong, with no exceptions, it's because we had inadequate diversity in the room."
>
> Source: Peter Schwartz, GBN founder

**Facilitation Skill Requirements**

> "Skilled facilitators like Peter perform – in an afternoon he can make them feel and behave differently. To be as fun and creative as it should be, you will also need skilled facilitators of the group process, talented writers, creative thinkers."
>
> Source: Analysis of GBN methodology

**Time Investment Requirement**

> "As time has gone on, and GBN has done more and more projects, there has been the need to find fast turnaround methods. However, to do scenario planning well – to do it thoughtfully, to absorb the ideas, to make better decisions – all of this takes time."
>

## 3. Process Sequencing: Order of Activities

### 3.1 Peter Schwartz's 8-Step Process ("The Art of the Long View")

From Schwartz's foundational book, the standard sequence:

1. **Identify the Focal Issue or Decision**
2. **Key Forces in the Local Environment**
3. **Driving Forces**
4. **Rank by Importance and Uncertainty**
5. **Selecting Scenario Logics**
6. **Fleshing out the Scenarios**
7. **Implications**
8. **Selection of Leading Indicators and Signposts**

> "The scenario planning process calls for developing challenging stories about possible futures by gathering data from broad sources and generating several divergent yet plausible scenarios."
>
> Source: Schwartz, "The Art of the Long View"

### 3.2 Van der Heijden's Process Steps

Standard scenario development involves:

1. **Defining focal issue, scope, and scenario agenda**
2. **Identifying key local factors and driving forces**
3. **Ranking factors and synthesizing critical uncertainties**
4. **Elaborating narratives, reviewing plausibility, and reiterating**

**Data-to-Narrative Flow**

> "The team uses data to find common and historical variables that turn into driving forces and conceptualization of variables along with Iceberg analysis (events, trends, patterns and structures). After the scenario team has gathered the data, the team will start formulizing scenarios which has a consistent story line."
>
> Source: Van der Heijden methodology analysis

### 3.3 Iteration Patterns

**NOT Linear - Deeply Iterative**

> "Shell's original insights came from 'years of deep research, rigorous analysis, ongoing conversations, and multiple iterations of the scenarios themselves.'"
>
> Source: Historical analysis of Shell scenario planning

**Interview-Synthesis-Refinement Loop**

> "A final step is to consider what gaps there are in the interview material. As well as considering what is obviously missing, the team can review strategic documents and public statements."
>
> Source: Scenario planning methodology guidance

**Workshop Splitting for Reflection**

> "Splitting the method into at least two half-days seems more effective: one for collecting and clustering information and one for interpreting and developing scenarios, allowing participants time to rethink and elaborate their ideas."
>
> Source: Research on scenario workshop facilitation

### 3.4 Transformative Scenario Planning (Kahane/Reos)

Adam Kahane developed an alternative multi-stakeholder approach:

> "The scenario team undertakes the core steps in three or four workshops of three to four days each, with supporting work being done in between the workshops, spread over four to eight months."
>
> Source: Reos Partners Transformative Scenario Planning methodology

This approach:
- Uses extended multi-workshop structure
- Includes substantial between-workshop work
- Focuses on collaborative multi-stakeholder dialogue
- Differs from Shell's original expert-team-driven model

## 4. Bias Management: How They Addressed Order Effects and Groupthink

### 4.1 Documented Bias Concerns

**Groupthink Prevention as Core Requirement**

> "Firms that pursue scenario planning with anticipation purposes prevent groupthink by generating new ideas, preventing fragmentation, and developing a collective understanding."
>
> Source: Academic research on scenario planning effectiveness

**Cognitive Bias Recognition**

> "Cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias or anchoring, can distort scenario planning, but techniques like the Delphi method can be used to gather diverse perspectives and challenge assumptions."
>
> Source: Research on scenario planning and cognitive biases

### 4.2 Shell's Structural Bias Mitigation Strategies

**1. Dedicated Scenario Team (Wack's Approach)**

By having the scenario team work separately and synthesize multiple expert perspectives:
- **Avoided anchoring**: Team synthesized all interviews before forming scenarios
- **Prevented dominant voices**: No single expert framed the problem in group settings
- **Enabled critical analysis**: Team had space to challenge assumptions

**2. "Remarkable People" Selection Criteria**

Selected for divergent thinking rather than consensus:
- Sought "unconventional insights" not conventional expertise
- Valued "power to reframe the discussion"
- Deliberately included perspectives from outside the industry

**3. Extended Timescales**

> "Unbalanced team between line and staff, and between internal and external contributions was identified as a risk to avoid."
>
> Source: Shell scenario planning risk analysis

One-year team induction and multi-month processes allowed:
- Time to challenge initial assumptions
- Multiple rounds of refinement
- Reduced pressure for premature convergence

### 4.3 Modern Workshop-Based Bias Prevention

**Four Critical Preconditions (from research)**

> "Research has identified four preconditions for effective scenario planning: 1) Ensure diverse group composition to stimulate divergent views, 2) reflect on and question the business-as-usual narrative, 3) implement a structured approach with steps divided over time, 4) provide leadership to support follow-up actions."
>
> Source: Academic research on scenario planning effectiveness

**Specific Facilitation Techniques**

From contemporary scenario planning research:

1. **Anonymous input methods**: Surveys, digital tools to reduce social pressure
2. **Junior voices first**: Let lower-status participants speak before seniors
3. **Devil's advocate role**: Designate someone to challenge assumptions
4. **Written pre-work**: Request input before meetings to establish independent thinking
5. **Small group breakouts**: Reduce dominant personality effects
6. **Structured turn-taking**: Ensure all voices heard

**Delphi Method Integration**

The RAND Delphi method addresses biases through:

> "By not meeting in person and keeping responses anonymous, the method reduces the likelihood of groupthink, as well as the impact of dominant personalities."
>
> Source: RAND Corporation Delphi methodology guidance

> "Asking a hand-picked group of anonymous experts the same questions several times and sharing the other experts' answers will help objectively develop group consensus."
>
> Source: RAND Delphi process description

### 4.4 Scenario Framing to Reduce Bias

**Neutral Naming**

> "In the Shell approach, scenarios should ideally not be obvious opposites, which might bias their acceptance by users, so the choice of 'neutral' titles is important."
>
> Source: Shell scenario planning guidance

**Avoiding Preference Signaling**

Scenarios should be presented as equally plausible to prevent:
- Anchoring on "preferred" scenario
- Dismissing "undesirable" scenarios
- Premature convergence on single future

## 5. Key Insights: What Matters Most for High-Quality Scenario Development

### 5.1 Time and Depth Over Speed

**Clear Evidence Against Two-Day Workshops**

The research consistently shows Shell's success came from:
- **Months, not days**: Multi-month processes with ongoing refinement
- **Deep expertise**: One-year team member induction
- **Iterative synthesis**: Multiple rounds of analysis and challenge

> "To do scenario planning well – to do it thoughtfully, to absorb the ideas, to make better decisions – all of this takes time."
>
> Source: GBN practitioner guidance

### 5.2 Expert Selection: Diverse and Unconventional

**Quality of Expertise Matters**

Not just any experts - specifically:
- People with unconventional insights
- Ability to reframe discussions
- Diverse backgrounds and perspectives
- External as well as internal voices

> "Diversity is the single most important characteristic for thinking about the future."
>
> Source: Peter Schwartz

### 5.3 Purpose: Mental Model Change, Not Prediction

**Fundamental Purpose Definition**

> "The purpose of the scenario and the scenario system is not to produce scenarios, the purpose is option creation, is to generate new options that you would not have thought of otherwise."
>
> Source: Pierre Wack (from Memorial Library documents)

This shifts evaluation criteria from "accuracy" to "impact on decision-making."

### 5.4 Team vs. Workshop: A Critical Choice

**Two Valid But Different Models**

**Model A: Dedicated Scenario Team (Original Shell)**
- Small expert team conducts interviews
- Team synthesizes over months
- Presents to decision-makers
- Avoids group dynamics biases
- Requires dedicated resources

**Model B: Facilitated Workshops (Later Shell, GBN, Reos)**
- Multi-stakeholder collaborative process
- Requires skilled facilitation
- Builds shared ownership
- Needs explicit bias prevention
- Can work on shorter timescales with trade-offs

**NOT documented**: A clear answer to "which is better" - both have been used successfully.

### 5.5 Iteration and Refinement

**Non-Negotiable Element**

All successful approaches include:
- Multiple rounds of refinement
- Challenging initial assumptions
- Testing scenario plausibility
- Revising based on gaps identified

> "Elaborating on narratives, reviewing their plausibility, and reiterating prior to publishing."
>
> Source: Standard scenario development process

### 5.6 Integration with Strategic Action

**Scenarios Are Not the End Product**

> "Four common practices work against Wack's conception: positioning scenarios as the outcome and the product of scenario planning, using scenarios in isolation, without attention to options, strategic vision or competitive positioning."
>
> Source: Analysis of Pierre Wack's approach

Success requires:
- Linking scenarios to strategic options
- Testing strategies against scenarios
- Using scenarios in ongoing strategic conversation
- Monitoring leading indicators

## 6. What Is NOT Well-Documented

Despite extensive research, several key questions lack clear documentation:

### 6.1 Order Effects in Workshop Settings

**What's Missing**: Specific guidance on whether experts should:
- Present perspectives sequentially (and if so, in what order)
- Work in parallel isolation then converge
- Engage in immediate dialogue

**What We Know**:
- Wack's team avoided the issue by conducting individual interviews
- Modern facilitation guides suggest techniques (junior first, anonymous input) but don't cite Shell specifically
- No documented Shell analysis of order effect management

### 6.2 Optimal Team Size

**Not Specified**: How many scenario team members? How many experts to interview?

**Known Examples**:
- Wack had a "small elite team" (size not specified)
- GBN conducted "hundreds" of interviews
- Workshop guidance says "multi-disciplinary team" (no numbers)

### 6.3 Decision-Maker Involvement Timing

**Unclear**: When and how often should decision-makers be involved during development vs. only at presentation?

**Known**:
- Wack's team presented to Managing Directors after development
- Van der Heijden emphasized ongoing "strategic conversation"
- The Shell 2001 project had explicit presentation phases

### 6.4 Quantitative Evidence on Bias Prevention

**Missing**: Controlled studies showing which bias prevention techniques work best in scenario planning

**Available**:
- Theoretical arguments for various techniques
- Practitioner reports of challenges
- Delphi method research (separate domain)
- No rigorous A/B testing of scenario planning facilitation methods

---

## 7. Comparison: Shell vs. Other Methodologies

### 7.1 RAND Corporation

**Origins**: Herman Kahn developed scenario method at RAND in 1950s

**Key Difference**:
- RAND focused on military forecasting
- Shell adapted for business strategy and mental model change
- RAND's Delphi method (anonymous expert iteration) addresses groupthink but wasn't integrated into early Shell work

### 7.2 SRI (Stanford Research Institute)

**Contribution**:
- Peter Schwartz worked at SRI before Shell
- Developed business applications of scenario planning
- Less documentation available on specific methodologies

### 7.3 La Prospective (French School)

**Different Philosophy**:
- More normative (desired futures)
- Shell's intuitive logics more exploratory
- Different analytical tools (morphological analysis, etc.)

### 7.4 Global Business Network

**Evolution of Shell Approach**:
- Founded by Shell alumni (Schwartz, et al.)
- Made methodology more accessible
- Developed faster workshop-based variants
- Maintained emphasis on "remarkable people" interviews
- More facilitator-centric than original Shell team approach

---

## 8. Practical Synthesis: Implications for Panel Design

### 8.1 The Core Trade-off

**Team-Based (Wack Model)**
- Advantages: Avoids group dynamics biases, enables deep synthesis
- Disadvantages: Requires dedicated team resources, slower process
- Best for: Organizations with scenario team capacity, complex strategic issues

**Workshop-Based (Van der Heijden/GBN Model)**
- Advantages: Builds stakeholder ownership, can work faster
- Disadvantages: Requires skilled facilitation, vulnerable to groupthink
- Best for: Multi-stakeholder contexts, time-constrained projects

### 8.2 If Experts Must Work Together: Evidence-Based Mitigation

Based on documented practices:

1. **Diverse composition** (most emphasized in research)
2. **Anonymous/independent input before discussion**
3. **Structured facilitation** with explicit anti-groupthink techniques
4. **Extended timeline** with breaks for reflection
5. **Devil's advocate roles**
6. **Junior voices first** to prevent anchoring on senior views

### 8.3 If Using AI Panel Simulation

The research suggests:

**Parallel-Then-Converge May Be Best**:
- Mimics Wack's interview approach (experts work independently)
- Avoids order effects by having all input before synthesis
- Allows synthesis agent to identify tensions and uncertainties
- Reflects "the scenario team interviewed people and thought deeply"

**But Also Consider**:
- Van der Heijden showed dialogue can work with good facilitation
- Modern practice values stakeholder ownership from collaboration
- The "strategic conversation" may surface insights isolated work misses

**NOT Documented**: A clear answer. Both approaches have been used successfully by Shell and successors.

## Conclusion

**The Central Finding**: Shell's most successful scenario planning under Pierre Wack did NOT use expert workshops where participants debated together. Instead, a dedicated scenario team conducted individual expert interviews over months, synthesized insights independently, and presented scenarios to decision-makers.

**Later Evolution**: Subsequent Shell leaders (van der Heijden) and Shell alumni (Schwartz/GBN) developed workshop-based collaborative approaches, but emphasized these require:
- Skilled facilitation
- Explicit bias prevention
- Extended timelines
- Ongoing strategic conversation
- Diverse participant selection

**The Unanswered Question**: There is no documented Shell position on whether experts working in parallel isolation vs. real-time dialogue is superior. Both models have been used successfully, suggesting context and execution quality matter more than the specific structure.

**Bias Management**: Well-documented techniques exist (diversity, anonymity, devil's advocate, structured process) but these come largely from general facilitation research and Delphi methodology, not from specific Shell scenario planning analysis of order effects or anchoring.

**Bottom Line for AI Panel Design**: The research supports either a parallel-then-synthesize approach (closer to Wack) or a facilitated dialogue approach (closer to van der Heijden/GBN), but emphasizes that success depends on:
1. Diverse expert selection
2. Adequate time for depth
3. Iterative refinement
4. Quality synthesis/facilitation
5. Focus on mental model change, not prediction
