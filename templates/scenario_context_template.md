# Scenario Context Updates

This file captures user feedback and clarifications that emerge during scenario planning.
Specialists in later rounds read this to understand evolved context.

## Instructions for Moderator

- Add timestamped entries after each checkpoint
- Be specific about what changed and why it matters
- Distinguish corrections, new context, and reactions
- Format: "## Phase [N] Round [N] - User Feedback (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)"
- For new inputs, record provenance so specialists treat them as claims, not facts:
  - Source type (open source, proprietary, expert, hearsay)
  - Confidence (low, medium, high)
  - Corroboration (none, partial, strong)
  - Recency (hours, days, weeks)
  - What would falsify this?
